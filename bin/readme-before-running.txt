\config\apikey.txt is where your telegram bot's api key is placed
\config\chatid.txt is the name of the telegram channel (don't include @ at the beginning)

the other files in \config\ are self-explanatory and already structured for your additions/removals of reddit and 4chan areas and keywords. keywords are treated as hashtags on twitter, submission titles on reddit and post content on 4chan.

populate these files prior to running the .exe or it won't work as intended and crash.
