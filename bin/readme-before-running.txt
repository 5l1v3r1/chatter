\config\apikey.txt is where your telegram bot's api key is placed
\config\chatid.txt is the name of the telegram channel (don't include @ at the beginnin)

the other files in \config\ are self-explanatory and already structured for your additions/removals of reddit and 4chan areas and keywords.

populate these files prior to running the .exe or it won't work as intended and crash.
