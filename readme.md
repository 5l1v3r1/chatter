**description**<br/>
chatter is a proof of concept osint monitoring telegram bot for windows (server, ideally) that monitors twitter hashtags, reddit titles and 4chan post content for specific keywords - as well as phrases in quotation marks. it feeds discovered content to a telegram group of your choosing in near real-time depending on your configuration settings. this is an [early release with limited features](https://github.com/visualbasic6/subdomain-bruteforce). i'm easily distracted and good at those.
